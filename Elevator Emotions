Elevator Emotions
Overworked and underpaid...
At least that fatso got off at floor 3...
It's a good day for a good day!
Ahhhhhh.
:)
:D
Life is good.
I'm an excellent driver.
I think that was a new PR!
Bop it to the top!
I won the race.
Oooof.
Meh.
Ho hum.
I'm happy today.
It's a good day.
I could do this all day!
Can't ask for more than that.
What's next?
I am feeling blue.
I'm feeling a bit down.
I'm a bit peeved because...
Can you believe it?
Don't ask.
It's hard to explain.
Can we be done with the stupid report already?
Is this really necessary?
Ok, so here's what happened:
Blah blah blah people blah...
I'm exhausted!
I'm sore!
I hope I never have to do that again.
This job is a pain.
This is the worst job ever.
I hate my job.
I hate everybody.
I hate my life.
I hate being an elevator.
You know what, why don't you try being an elevator?
It's not funny.
Hindsight is 20/20
I could use a nice cold beer right about now.
It's a good thing I had two cups of coffee this morning!
All in a day's work.
You know, this would be a lot easier if...
Oh, nevermind.
I'm a good elevator.
I'm a good little elevator.
Nobody puts baby bird in an elevator!
I'm as chipper as always.
The little engine who could.
No use crying over spilled milk.
It isn't every day you see something like that.
You know what? I quit. I mean it this time.
I'd like to see them do my job all day.
Up and down.
I've been better.
Gotta have your highs and lows.
Well that wasn't so bad.
This is easier than I expected.
That was more fun than I expected.
That was even worse than I expected.
That was nothing to be afraid of.
I'm bored.
This is so boring!
Boooooring!
This is lame.
Can we be done now?
I don't want to talk about it.
Are we there yet?
Constant bickering.
You know that awkward moment when you're an elevator and...
So I was like - oh yeah, where were we?
Two lawyers walk into an elevator...
An elevator walks into a bar...
Like I've never heard that one before.
That guy is a hoot!
